This is an incoherent and mostly uninteresting collection of posts on a variety of topics. Generally these are small guides aimed at helping others save some time, and making sure I'm not forgetting how I fixed something.

I'm a software developer and manager in the daytime and tinkerer in the evenings. I love tinkering with technology.
