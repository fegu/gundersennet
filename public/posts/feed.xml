      <title>.Net&#39;s defective-by-default browser capabilities detection lends itself to DoS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since .Net v4, in all versions including the last classic .Net version v4.8, the built-in browser detection accessible in the Request.Browser (a HttpBrowserCapabilities object) has a serious flaw which will bite you as soon as your site gets several visitors per minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens, if you rely on this object, is that users will randomly report having their browser mis-identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post shows why it happens and how to solve it. The issue is also easy to reproduce locally, worth a few fun minutes. If you are so inclined, the problem also lends itself to a DoS attack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lenovo X1 Nano - actual use</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/lenovo-x1-nano-hands-on-practical-use-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used the X1 Nano heavily for the last few days after configuring it with all the software I use as a software developer and manager. If you are considering the X1 Nano, but is wondering how it really is, this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nano%5Flap%5Ftop.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the first model available in Scandinavia, the Core i5 16/256GB with 4G and non-touch matte 2160px 16:10 screen with extended warranty (20UN002CMX). This came from the first shipment to Norway, while Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s own web shop still just said &amp;ldquo;Coming soon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Replacing thermal paste on Lenovo X1 Carbon to reduce temp, fan noise and CPU-throttling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have exclusively used Lenovo (used to be IBM) Thinkpads for over 20 years, opting for X1 Carbons since the launch. Almost all Lenovo laptops suffer thermal throttling and excessive heating after a few years. Here is how to solve this issue, shown on a X1 Carbon Gen 3 (but they are quite similar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom is easy to remove, just a few standard Philips screws. Inside, the cooling assembly with fan and heat sink is located top left.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solved: Azure Function &#34;Publish Failed&#34; from Visual Studio 2017</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Publishing failed&amp;rdquo; error message will make you feel cursed. It appears when publishing an Azure serverless Function directly from Visual Studio 2017. Some never see it, but those who do can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/publishfailed%5F450px.png&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried all the recommended internet forum voodoo of creating new deployment profiles, restarting Visual Studio, cleaning the project and downloading deployment profiles. If it did go away for once, it always came back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modifying an IKEA Trådfri mains switch to become a potential free/non voltage relay, using only two components, even leaving the mains outlet free for other use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IKEA Trådfri (or Tradfri) smart home system is inexpensive and widely available, but limited in functionality. If you want more, for instance a simple relay (not connected to mains), you need to get it somewhere else, often necessitating the install of another Zigbee controller in addition to the IKEA one. Instead, I modified a Trådfri outlet switch to become a potential free relay to control the garage door.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solved: Dell DRAC 5 not responding</title>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://gundersen.net/?p=435</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I suddenly found myself in charge of an unresponsive old Dell PowerEdge 1950 server with a DRAC 5 remote management card from 2006. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask. The DRAC was pingable, but did not respond to http/https. When that was sorted out, the remote console did not want to play nice, because Java. The solution was long-winded and might help others, so here it is. Start at whatever step suits you, it is all a case of IT archeology at this point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solved: Asus 4G-AC55U randomly going offline</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/solved-asus-4g-ac55u-randomly-going-offline/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://gundersen.net/?p=418</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Asus 4G router can be great, if configured correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has excellent sensitivity. Previously, I needed an external (outdoors) antenna to get 3G and 4G (LTE) coverage at the cabin; but the AC55U is sensitive enough to get the same reception indoors. I have another one at a remote shooting range to provide WiFi there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, even with the (at writing) most recent firmware 3.0.0.4.378_8071, it suddenly disconnects from the mobile provider or refuses to route traffic. At first I wrote it off as random service issues with the mobile coverage. After all, these are rural areas with weak signal. But the outages kept appearing while my cell phone worked fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Functional Floppy Disks - in 2015</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/functional-floppy-disks-in-2015/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2015 20:12:02 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://gundersen.net/?p=385</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Update December 2015: This project has now ended and the floppy era is over - for me at least. The project has been featured quite a bit in the press and blogosphere. Most notably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p034h09c&#34;&gt;BBC World Service (14min12sek in)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/298-shadow-work-surge-pricing-seeing-through-walls-and-more-1.3289284/floppy-disks-just-what-the-doctor-ordered-1.3293207&#34;&gt;CBC Spark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nrk.no/rogaland/pasientlister-pa-disketter-1.11815307&#34;&gt;Norwegian National Broadcasting (NRK)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dagbladet.no/2015/10/02/nyheter/innenriks/fastlegeordningen/helse/teknologi/41286221/&#34;&gt;Dagbladet (national newspaper)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mass production of the venerable floppy disk stopped about 2010, some are still needed for applications designed in the nineties. It is actually possible to work with floppy disks on an almost daily basis at work, in 2015. In fact, I do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SSL Host Header with wildcard certificate on IIS7 solved</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/ssl-host-header-with-wildcard-certificate-on-iis7-explained/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2015 13:49:05 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://gundersen.net/?p=363</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When adding a HTTPS site on IIS7, the Host header field is disabled. If you have one IP per site, as used to be the requirement, this is not a problem. But when you want to host multiple sites on one IP, it is a show stopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case I had a wildcard certificate, and ran into this when adding my second site. It was important not to cause any down-time on the already running site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OpenVPN server on FreeBSD with pf firewall</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/openvpn-server-on-freebsd-with-pf-firewall/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=306</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD 10, with the new and improved packet filter/firewall pf, and OpenVPN are all great products. But I had a not so great time making them play together - especially with a Windows 8 client. As with everything, it is easy when you know how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most OpenVPN examples seem to be using the tap interface and ethernet bridging. To keep things simple, I wanted to go with the default ip-routed tun interface. Apart from being default, thus requiring less config fiddling, it fits nicely with pf and requires one less kernel module.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unreal Tournament Server on FreeBSD</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/unreal-tournament-server-on-freebsd/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=298</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unreal Tournament from 1999 (Game of the Year - GOTY - Edition) is now 15 years old and still a great multiplayer game, especially at LAN parties. It is free to download so you can share this gem with anyone. If you play it regularly you will want to host a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide for FreeBSD closely follows the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.unrealadmin.org/Server_Install_linux&#34;&gt;Linux guide&lt;/a&gt;, but as always FreeBSD needs a couple of adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all make a new user with adduser. All default settings, I call mine ut99.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>4x4x4 3D RGB Charlie Cube by Stavanger Makerspace</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/charliecube/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=270</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last two Sundays, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Stavanger-Makerspace/&#34; title=&#34;Stavanger Makerspace&#34;&gt;Stavanger Makerspace&lt;/a&gt; hosted meetups to build 4x4x4 RBG LED Arduino-controlled &amp;ldquo;charlie cubes&amp;rdquo;. A charlie cube, originally designed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://aglick.com/charliecube.html&#34;&gt;Asher Glick and Kevin Baker&lt;/a&gt;, uses a minimum of components and can be made very cheap by using just an Arduino nano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie-cube projects abound on the internet, but the amount of soldering points suspended only by thin wires often leads to misaligned results. Our intrepid member &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Stavanger-Makerspace/members/54632462/&#34; title=&#34;Kjetil Eik&#34;&gt;Kjetil Eik&lt;/a&gt;, known for impressive 3D prints on his sturdy &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.felixprinters.com/&#34; title=&#34;Felix&#34;&gt;Felix&lt;/a&gt;, thought we could do better. He designed and printed tools and jigs to straighten out what would otherwise have been a crooked crowd. He also designed a PCB to avoid the messy breadboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>American Netflix on any device without VPN or site-wide DNS changes - using pfSsense</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/american-netflix-on-ipad-and-chromecast-without-vpn-using-pfsense/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2014 13:04:16 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=256</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like everyone is finding ways to watch American Netflix content. While it is easy with one of many plugins on the computer, it gets harder on devices such as iPad or PS3 and even more so on Chromecast with its hard-coded google DNS. Some people will also want a solution for the home router, covering all devices at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common fix is to get a VPN. Usable from the computer, iPad, Chromecast or a sufficiently advanced router, a VPN routes your traffic through a server in the US. The main drawback is speed. Most VPN providers are over-subscribed and, in general, it will be hard to get Super HD streaming - at least with any stability and on more than one device. You will also want to separate your other browsing traffic from the VPN to avoid the speed loss, and avoid having all websites think you are from the US. All in all, a solution with drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Altibox med egen ruter med pfSense</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/altibox-med-egen-ruter-med-pfsense/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2014 13:54:25 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=244</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denne posten fra 2014 er oppdatert i 2015 med IPv6-innstillinger - se nederst.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De fleste som har Altibox fiber-bredbånd og vil bruke egen ruter hjemme setter Altibox-ruteren i bridge-mode. Men det er unødvendig å ha den som et ekstra ledd mellom deg og internett. Du kan like gjerne kople din egen ruter eller server rett på linjen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;//gundersen.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Zyxel%5FAltibox.jpg&#34;
         alt=&#34;Denne trengs ikke&#34; width=&#34;450&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Denne trengs ikke&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Om du ikke har vært Altiboxkunde alt for lenge så har du en mediekonverter foran ruteren som leveres av Altibox. Da kopler du deg direkte i mediekonverteren. Har du ikke en mediekonverter er jobben litt mer innfløkt fordi du må direkte på fiberen med f.eks egen mediekonverter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keep iPad/iPhone iOS keyboard up between input fields</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/keep-ipadiphone-ios-keyboard-up-between-input-fields/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2013 00:47:18 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=219</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The iPad and iPhone has more than a few quirks web developers need to handle. One of them is being quite insistent on when to show and hide the on-screen keyboard. The default iPad behaviour, in all iOS versions, is to drop the keyboard between input fields, and to deny programmatically showing the keyboard on focus changes. It is only shown when the user taps an input field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is adequate for most situations, it can be really frustrating in cases of several fixed-width input fields in a row.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Det er vinter og tid for karamellpudding. I år lages den sous vide. Det er foreløpig vanskelig å finne konkrete fremgangsmåter på web, men fortvil ikke, etter litt prøving og feiling er oppskriften her — og resultatet blir perfekt hver gang. Oppskriften fungerer også fint for vanlig ovn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 5 personer trengs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3dl sukker til karamell (blir mer enn nok)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1dl sukker til pudding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6dl lettmelk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3dl fløte&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Intel is pushing a new form factor, the Next Unit of Computing (NUC), and it is looking good. I recently got two of these and have some pictures and experiences to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NUCs have some exciting properties and a couple of gotchas, read on and avoid my mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;NUC box&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;//gundersen.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/NUC-box.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all the box itself has a small surprise. When it opens it plays the Intel jingle from some embedded electronics with a light-sensor and a speaker. Oh, the humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Functional Programming, as a paradigm, does not have users, it has devotees. I am myself one of those, spending time in Haskell as often as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why then, if it is so great, has FP not taken over the software development world?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many answers to this question, ranging from the condescending (&amp;ldquo;is hard&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;has no practical use&amp;rdquo;) to the hopeful (&amp;ldquo;just haven&amp;rsquo;t reached critical mass&amp;rdquo;). This post is about another, often overlooked, fundamental reason:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is a versatile and cheap piece of gear. While neat, it has pieces protruding from every side and as it turns out, this made it just slightly too wide for the enclosure I had in mind. No biggie, we can slim it down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts bothering us the most are the RCA connector, the audio jack and the SD-card. This being 2013, we are not going to miss neither the RCA nor the old-school audio.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solved: Chrome downloading file instead of displaying page</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/chrome-downloading-file-instead-of-displaying-page-solved/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=133</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of developers are experiencing the same problem: while all other browsers display your latest web creation perfectly, Chrome just downloads the script source file - yes, source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href=&#34;http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/_cA0qdJ4LHI&#34;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://getsatisfaction.com/tibbo/topics/chrome_downloads_file_instead_of_displaying_web_page&#34;&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt; describe the same problem, suggesting everything from security flaws and misconfigured servers to a chrome bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;chrome_download&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;//gundersen.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/chrome_download.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: you visited your unfinished site in Chrome before it was configured correctly. Chrome correctly just downloaded your front page script file - &lt;strong&gt;and it has cached that result, showing it to you again and again&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keyboard language suddenly changing: solved</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/keyboard-language-suddenly-changing/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=119</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time my keyboard input language sometimes changed for no apparent reason. I have two languages installed, and windows seemed to switch between them at will. It happened almost exclusively while using SQL Server Management Studio, and I wrote it off as an annoying bug in that product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, last night, it happened during a presentation. While the consensus of the audience feedback seemed to be that this was a common occurence, one guy suggested it might be because of an unfortunate keyboard shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Haskell on Windows</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/haskell-on-windows/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Haskell is fascinating, but getting started can be a bit rough - especially if you are on Windows. Here are some necessary steps to get you over these initial stumbling blocks when running the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org&#34; title=&#34;Haskell Platform&#34;&gt;Haskell Platform&lt;/a&gt; (2012.4 or 2014.2) on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite obvioius that a lot of the users of Haskell are on other platforms, and as a Windows-user you quickly run into some problems not experienced on other platforms. This is doubly frustrating as a newbie because you haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to develop the necessary intuition about where to look for solutions yet. It also certainly does not help that Haskell error messages are known to be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pidgin to Lync integration: solved</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been trying to get the open source instant messenger client &lt;a href=&#34;http://pidgin.im&#34; title=&#34;Pidgin&#34;&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt; to connect to Lync using &lt;a href=&#34;http://sipe.sourceforge.net&#34; title=&#34;SIPE&#34;&gt;SIPE&lt;/a&gt;. However, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t play nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pidgin GUI kept saying &amp;ldquo;Web ticket request to https:// webdir0e- ext.online.lync.com:443/ CertProv/ CertProvisioningService.svc failed&amp;rdquo; while the debug log from running pidgin &amp;ndash;debug ended with an XML containing &amp;ldquo;Web ticket request error - SIP URI mismatch&amp;rdquo; - after confirming username and password to be ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My environment was Pidgin 2.10.7 and SIPE 1.15.0 on Win8 connecting to Office 365 (no local AD).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More SSD space: how I got an extra 13GB free</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/more-ssd-space-how-i-got-an-extra-13gb/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SSDs are great (except &lt;a href=&#34;//gundersen.net/solid-state-drives-the-best-of-drives-the-worst-of-drives/&#34; title=&#34;Solid State Drives: the best of drives, the worst of drives&#34;&gt;they can also be the worst of drives&lt;/a&gt;), but they usually have less capacity than modern conventional drives. In 2013, 128GB is still a common size, and even a 256GB drive can only hold so much. At the same time, main memory is increasing and 8GB of RAM is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing main memory will often reserve unnecessary space on your drive for hibernation and paging. This  guide shows how to reclaim that space on Windows 7 and Windows 8 (but should work for any windows with minimal changes).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>32bit jail on 64bit FreeBSD</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it can be necessary or preferable to run software in 32bit versions, even if the OS is 64bit (i.e. running the i386-version on amd64 OS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, software with deep memory structures mainly consisting of pointers, such as dictionaries of dictionaries of light-weight objects, will occupy almost twice the RAM on a 64bit OS. If multiple instances of, say, 3GB memory structures are needed, the 64bit penalty quickly adds up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packards Microserver is great value for money. At work we have bought the more expensive rack-mount ProLiants for ten years, and with the microserver I have transitioned to HP for my home server as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inexpensive, extensible, low-noise, small and with a slick black finish. Thumbscrews for case and mainboard, lots and lots of spare screws in the back of the front door together with a supplied torx-tool, and neat cable routing.  Let&amp;rsquo;s open it up and have a look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Low-cost MicroSIM</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several new phones, such as the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy S3, requires a smaller SIM card. Such a MicroSIM is nothing but an ordinary sim-card with some superfluous plastic removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are there, in the shop with your new phone, you are eager to get started with it. Some stores know to take advantage of that and will charge you extra for the microsim. For just a few moments of their time, putting your old sim through a somewhat special hole-punch, they can charge as much as $30.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MicroSIM til halve prisen</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mange nye telefoner, som iPhone og Samsung Galaxy S3, krever et SIM-kort som er mindre enn vanlig. Et slikt mikrosim er bare et vanlig SIM-kort med overflødig plast klippet bort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Når man står hos i butikken med den nye telefonen i hånda er man ganske ivrig på å komme i gang. Det vet Telehuset å benytte seg av. For jobben med å putte inn ditt gamle SIM i en litt spesiell hullmaskin, klemme hardt, og gi deg det samme SIM-kortet tilbake, tar de uten blygsel 199kr. For noen svært få sekunders jobb. For vilt til å være sant? Ta en tur innom et Telehus og spør.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Under the hood of a SSD</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Solid state drives look surprisingly simple under the cover. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the 2.5&amp;quot; form factor they inherited from ordinary drives, they could probably be both smaller and lighter than today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;//gundersen.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ssd11.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shown here is a 160GB Intel SSD. The die cast aluminium casing is surprisingly thin and light. It is held together with four small screws, some of which are covered by do not void stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10 large chips comprises the actual storage, 16GB each. The two other chips are controllers for the storage and SATA interface.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Compiling Teeworlds Server</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post was updated in December 2015 to account for clang in FreeBSD and the updated Teeworlds 0.6.3 (which contains an important server bugfix).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teeworlds is a great game. It is free and runs on any platform, &lt;a href=&#34;http://teeworlds.com&#34;&gt;download it now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will soon want to run your own server to host your own matches and levels. If you have a FreeBSD server without X, this is not straightforward. The FreeBSD Teeworlds package is game (client) and server bundled in one, and the Teeworlds server sources are meant for Linux. Here is how:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Back to basic: convert dynamic disks without formatting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last time a dynamic disk in Windows has gone rogue on me. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into why I even used them, but here is how to get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you are stuck with an &amp;ldquo;Invalid Dynamid Disk&amp;rdquo;, unable to use the disk manager in the computer management applet of control panel&amp;rsquo;s administrative tools (or, at least unable to have it convert back to basic disk without formatting), then this is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solid State Drives: the best of drives, the worst of drives</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no denying that solid state hard drives have a lot of advantages. They are fast, silent and runs cooler than ordinary drives. But when they fail, they fail hard. Really hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;//gundersen.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ssd2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Intel 160GB SSD stock drive in my Lenovo T420s failed in May 2012, less than one year after the manufacturing date. And when I say failed, I mean it. The laptop suddenly responded slowly, then after a few seconds completely froze, gave a blue-screen and died. It would not reboot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
