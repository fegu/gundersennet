      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used the X1 Nano heavily for the last few days after configuring it with all the software I use as a software developer and manager. If you are considering the X1 Nano, but is wondering how it really is, this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the first model available in Scandinavia, the Core i5 16/256GB with 4G and non-touch matte 2160px 16:10 screen with extended warranty (20UN002CMX). This came from the first shipment to Norway, while Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s own web shop still just said &amp;ldquo;Coming soon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have exclusively used Lenovo (used to be IBM) Thinkpads for over 20 years, opting for X1 Carbons since the launch. Almost all Lenovo laptops suffer thermal throttling and excessive heating after a few years. Here is how to solve this issue, shown on a X1 Carbon Gen 3 (but they are quite similar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom is easy to remove, just a few standard Philips screws. Inside, the cooling assembly with fan and heat sink is located top left.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solid State Drives: the best of drives, the worst of drives</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no denying that solid state hard drives have a lot of advantages. They are fast, silent and runs cooler than ordinary drives. But when they fail, they fail hard. Really hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;//gundersen.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ssd2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Intel 160GB SSD stock drive in my Lenovo T420s failed in May 2012, less than one year after the manufacturing date. And when I say failed, I mean it. The laptop suddenly responded slowly, then after a few seconds completely froze, gave a blue-screen and died. It would not reboot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
