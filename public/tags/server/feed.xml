      <description>&lt;p&gt;I suddenly found myself in charge of an unresponsive old Dell PowerEdge 1950 server with a DRAC 5 remote management card from 2006. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask. The DRAC was pingable, but did not respond to http/https. When that was sorted out, the remote console did not want to play nice, because Java. The solution was long-winded and might help others, so here it is. Start at whatever step suits you, it is all a case of IT archeology at this point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SSL Host Header with wildcard certificate on IIS7 solved</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When adding a HTTPS site on IIS7, the Host header field is disabled. If you have one IP per site, as used to be the requirement, this is not a problem. But when you want to host multiple sites on one IP, it is a show stopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case I had a wildcard certificate, and ran into this when adding my second site. It was important not to cause any down-time on the already running site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
