      <title>SSL Host Header with wildcard certificate on IIS7 solved</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/ssl-host-header-with-wildcard-certificate-on-iis7-explained/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When adding a HTTPS site on IIS7, the Host header field is disabled. If you have one IP per site, as used to be the requirement, this is not a problem. But when you want to host multiple sites on one IP, it is a show stopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case I had a wildcard certificate, and ran into this when adding my second site. It was important not to cause any down-time on the already running site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keyboard language suddenly changing: solved</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/keyboard-language-suddenly-changing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time my keyboard input language sometimes changed for no apparent reason. I have two languages installed, and windows seemed to switch between them at will. It happened almost exclusively while using SQL Server Management Studio, and I wrote it off as an annoying bug in that product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, last night, it happened during a presentation. While the consensus of the audience feedback seemed to be that this was a common occurence, one guy suggested it might be because of an unfortunate keyboard shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Haskell on Windows</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/haskell-on-windows/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Haskell is fascinating, but getting started can be a bit rough - especially if you are on Windows. Here are some necessary steps to get you over these initial stumbling blocks when running the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org&#34; title=&#34;Haskell Platform&#34;&gt;Haskell Platform&lt;/a&gt; (2012.4 or 2014.2) on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite obvioius that a lot of the users of Haskell are on other platforms, and as a Windows-user you quickly run into some problems not experienced on other platforms. This is doubly frustrating as a newbie because you haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to develop the necessary intuition about where to look for solutions yet. It also certainly does not help that Haskell error messages are known to be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More SSD space: how I got an extra 13GB free</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/more-ssd-space-how-i-got-an-extra-13gb/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SSDs are great (except &lt;a href=&#34;//gundersen.net/solid-state-drives-the-best-of-drives-the-worst-of-drives/&#34; title=&#34;Solid State Drives: the best of drives, the worst of drives&#34;&gt;they can also be the worst of drives&lt;/a&gt;), but they usually have less capacity than modern conventional drives. In 2013, 128GB is still a common size, and even a 256GB drive can only hold so much. At the same time, main memory is increasing and 8GB of RAM is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing main memory will often reserve unnecessary space on your drive for hibernation and paging. This  guide shows how to reclaim that space on Windows 7 and Windows 8 (but should work for any windows with minimal changes).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Back to basic: convert dynamic disks without formatting</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/back-to-basic-convert-dynamic-disks-without-formatting/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last time a dynamic disk in Windows has gone rogue on me. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into why I even used them, but here is how to get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you are stuck with an &amp;ldquo;Invalid Dynamid Disk&amp;rdquo;, unable to use the disk manager in the computer management applet of control panel&amp;rsquo;s administrative tools (or, at least unable to have it convert back to basic disk without formatting), then this is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
