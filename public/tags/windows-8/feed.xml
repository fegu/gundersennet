      <title>Keyboard language suddenly changing: solved</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time my keyboard input language sometimes changed for no apparent reason. I have two languages installed, and windows seemed to switch between them at will. It happened almost exclusively while using SQL Server Management Studio, and I wrote it off as an annoying bug in that product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, last night, it happened during a presentation. While the consensus of the audience feedback seemed to be that this was a common occurence, one guy suggested it might be because of an unfortunate keyboard shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Haskell on Windows</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/haskell-on-windows/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Haskell is fascinating, but getting started can be a bit rough - especially if you are on Windows. Here are some necessary steps to get you over these initial stumbling blocks when running the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org&#34; title=&#34;Haskell Platform&#34;&gt;Haskell Platform&lt;/a&gt; (2012.4 or 2014.2) on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite obvioius that a lot of the users of Haskell are on other platforms, and as a Windows-user you quickly run into some problems not experienced on other platforms. This is doubly frustrating as a newbie because you haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to develop the necessary intuition about where to look for solutions yet. It also certainly does not help that Haskell error messages are known to be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pidgin to Lync integration: solved</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/pidgin-and-lync-problem-solved/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been trying to get the open source instant messenger client &lt;a href=&#34;http://pidgin.im&#34; title=&#34;Pidgin&#34;&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt; to connect to Lync using &lt;a href=&#34;http://sipe.sourceforge.net&#34; title=&#34;SIPE&#34;&gt;SIPE&lt;/a&gt;. However, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t play nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pidgin GUI kept saying &amp;ldquo;Web ticket request to https:// webdir0e- ext.online.lync.com:443/ CertProv/ CertProvisioningService.svc failed&amp;rdquo; while the debug log from running pidgin &amp;ndash;debug ended with an XML containing &amp;ldquo;Web ticket request error - SIP URI mismatch&amp;rdquo; - after confirming username and password to be ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My environment was Pidgin 2.10.7 and SIPE 1.15.0 on Win8 connecting to Office 365 (no local AD).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More SSD space: how I got an extra 13GB free</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SSDs are great (except &lt;a href=&#34;//gundersen.net/solid-state-drives-the-best-of-drives-the-worst-of-drives/&#34; title=&#34;Solid State Drives: the best of drives, the worst of drives&#34;&gt;they can also be the worst of drives&lt;/a&gt;), but they usually have less capacity than modern conventional drives. In 2013, 128GB is still a common size, and even a 256GB drive can only hold so much. At the same time, main memory is increasing and 8GB of RAM is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing main memory will often reserve unnecessary space on your drive for hibernation and paging. This  guide shows how to reclaim that space on Windows 7 and Windows 8 (but should work for any windows with minimal changes).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
