      <title>Lenovo X1 Nano - actual use</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/lenovo-x1-nano-hands-on-practical-use-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used the X1 Nano heavily for the last few days after configuring it with all the software I use as a software developer and manager. If you are considering the X1 Nano, but is wondering how it really is, this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the first model available in Scandinavia, the Core i5 16/256GB with 4G and non-touch matte 2160px 16:10 screen with extended warranty (20UN002CMX). This came from the first shipment to Norway, while Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s own web shop still just said &amp;ldquo;Coming soon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SSL Host Header with wildcard certificate on IIS7 solved</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/ssl-host-header-with-wildcard-certificate-on-iis7-explained/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When adding a HTTPS site on IIS7, the Host header field is disabled. If you have one IP per site, as used to be the requirement, this is not a problem. But when you want to host multiple sites on one IP, it is a show stopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case I had a wildcard certificate, and ran into this when adding my second site. It was important not to cause any down-time on the already running site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solved: Chrome downloading file instead of displaying page</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/chrome-downloading-file-instead-of-displaying-page-solved/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of developers are experiencing the same problem: while all other browsers display your latest web creation perfectly, Chrome just downloads the script source file - yes, source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href=&#34;http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/_cA0qdJ4LHI&#34;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://getsatisfaction.com/tibbo/topics/chrome_downloads_file_instead_of_displaying_web_page&#34;&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt; describe the same problem, suggesting everything from security flaws and misconfigured servers to a chrome bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;chrome_download&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;//gundersen.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/chrome_download.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: you visited your unfinished site in Chrome before it was configured correctly. Chrome correctly just downloaded your front page script file - &lt;strong&gt;and it has cached that result, showing it to you again and again&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keyboard language suddenly changing: solved</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/keyboard-language-suddenly-changing/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=119</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time my keyboard input language sometimes changed for no apparent reason. I have two languages installed, and windows seemed to switch between them at will. It happened almost exclusively while using SQL Server Management Studio, and I wrote it off as an annoying bug in that product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, last night, it happened during a presentation. While the consensus of the audience feedback seemed to be that this was a common occurence, one guy suggested it might be because of an unfortunate keyboard shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Haskell on Windows</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/haskell-on-windows/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2013 13:17:07 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=111</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Haskell is fascinating, but getting started can be a bit rough - especially if you are on Windows. Here are some necessary steps to get you over these initial stumbling blocks when running the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org&#34; title=&#34;Haskell Platform&#34;&gt;Haskell Platform&lt;/a&gt; (2012.4 or 2014.2) on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite obvioius that a lot of the users of Haskell are on other platforms, and as a Windows-user you quickly run into some problems not experienced on other platforms. This is doubly frustrating as a newbie because you haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to develop the necessary intuition about where to look for solutions yet. It also certainly does not help that Haskell error messages are known to be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pidgin to Lync integration: solved</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/pidgin-and-lync-problem-solved/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2013 21:38:18 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=101</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had been trying to get the open source instant messenger client &lt;a href=&#34;http://pidgin.im&#34; title=&#34;Pidgin&#34;&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt; to connect to Lync using &lt;a href=&#34;http://sipe.sourceforge.net&#34; title=&#34;SIPE&#34;&gt;SIPE&lt;/a&gt;. However, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t play nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pidgin GUI kept saying &amp;ldquo;Web ticket request to https:// webdir0e- ext.online.lync.com:443/ CertProv/ CertProvisioningService.svc failed&amp;rdquo; while the debug log from running pidgin &amp;ndash;debug ended with an XML containing &amp;ldquo;Web ticket request error - SIP URI mismatch&amp;rdquo; - after confirming username and password to be ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My environment was Pidgin 2.10.7 and SIPE 1.15.0 on Win8 connecting to Office 365 (no local AD).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More SSD space: how I got an extra 13GB free</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/more-ssd-space-how-i-got-an-extra-13gb/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2013 11:52:30 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SSDs are great (except &lt;a href=&#34;//gundersen.net/solid-state-drives-the-best-of-drives-the-worst-of-drives/&#34; title=&#34;Solid State Drives: the best of drives, the worst of drives&#34;&gt;they can also be the worst of drives&lt;/a&gt;), but they usually have less capacity than modern conventional drives. In 2013, 128GB is still a common size, and even a 256GB drive can only hold so much. At the same time, main memory is increasing and 8GB of RAM is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing main memory will often reserve unnecessary space on your drive for hibernation and paging. This  guide shows how to reclaim that space on Windows 7 and Windows 8 (but should work for any windows with minimal changes).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Back to basic: convert dynamic disks without formatting</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/back-to-basic-convert-dynamic-disks-without-formatting/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2012 19:11:31 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.gundersen.net/?p=13</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last time a dynamic disk in Windows has gone rogue on me. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into why I even used them, but here is how to get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you are stuck with an &amp;ldquo;Invalid Dynamid Disk&amp;rdquo;, unable to use the disk manager in the computer management applet of control panel&amp;rsquo;s administrative tools (or, at least unable to have it convert back to basic disk without formatting), then this is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
