      <title>Replacing thermal paste on Lenovo X1 Carbon to reduce temp, fan noise and CPU-throttling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have exclusively used Lenovo (used to be IBM) Thinkpads for over 20 years, opting for X1 Carbons since the launch. Almost all Lenovo laptops suffer thermal throttling and excessive heating after a few years. Here is how to solve this issue, shown on a X1 Carbon Gen 3 (but they are quite similar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom is easy to remove, just a few standard Philips screws. Inside, the cooling assembly with fan and heat sink is located top left.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IKEA Trådfri Garage Opener</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modifying an IKEA Trådfri mains switch to become a potential free/non voltage relay, using only two components, even leaving the mains outlet free for other use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IKEA Trådfri (or Tradfri) smart home system is inexpensive and widely available, but limited in functionality. If you want more, for instance a simple relay (not connected to mains), you need to get it somewhere else, often necessitating the install of another Zigbee controller in addition to the IKEA one. Instead, I modified a Trådfri outlet switch to become a potential free relay to control the garage door.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>4x4x4 3D RGB Charlie Cube by Stavanger Makerspace</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last two Sundays, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Stavanger-Makerspace/&#34; title=&#34;Stavanger Makerspace&#34;&gt;Stavanger Makerspace&lt;/a&gt; hosted meetups to build 4x4x4 RBG LED Arduino-controlled &amp;ldquo;charlie cubes&amp;rdquo;. A charlie cube, originally designed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://aglick.com/charliecube.html&#34;&gt;Asher Glick and Kevin Baker&lt;/a&gt;, uses a minimum of components and can be made very cheap by using just an Arduino nano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie-cube projects abound on the internet, but the amount of soldering points suspended only by thin wires often leads to misaligned results. Our intrepid member &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Stavanger-Makerspace/members/54632462/&#34; title=&#34;Kjetil Eik&#34;&gt;Kjetil Eik&lt;/a&gt;, known for impressive 3D prints on his sturdy &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.felixprinters.com/&#34; title=&#34;Felix&#34;&gt;Felix&lt;/a&gt;, thought we could do better. He designed and printed tools and jigs to straighten out what would otherwise have been a crooked crowd. He also designed a PCB to avoid the messy breadboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
