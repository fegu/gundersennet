    Thank you.

    Trying to install cd /usr/ports/emulators/virtualbox-ose within a 64bit jail was not going well.

    I was shocked how easy your 32bit jail concept was. The bsdinstall binary is quite frankly rubbish!

    A question:
    I have set up a 32-bit system &amp; port build (&amp;install) jail for my soekris on my amd64 install.
    How do I update it? Make installworld dies with "<i>install: rename: /lib/INS@Oz23 to /lib/libc.so.7: Operation not permitted</i>".
    If I turn off the <i>schg</i> flag for <i>/lib/libc.so.7</i>, the file simply gets deleted and not copied over and the install dies on the next line for that file.
    I would prefer to keep the jail's build processes separate because accidentally mixing the architectures would be <i>bad</i>.

    This article should be added to the FreeBSD handbook as it is still not made clear in there how to do this really common.

    The instance specific settings e.g.jail_32bitjail_rootdir=”/usr/jails/32bitjail”
    are now handled in /etc/jail.conf

    The /etc/rc.d/jail script leads you through well enough to figure it out.

    The handbook (as at 4th Feb 2015)  is yet to be updated with the new config file info.

However, as a result, if you still have your old BPOS login (or potentially any other value than whatever the correct value might be) in the Login field, Office 365 will return a different cryptic error:\n\"The specified member name is either invalid or empty.\"\nThis was really confusing to me, as I haven't touched my config settings since we were upgraded to Office 365 in March 2012, and it had been working happily all this time...  \nIn my case, setting the Login value to blank restored connectivity for me.  If that hadn't worked, Stefan suggested I would have needed to determine what the current correct value for my O365 login is and supply that instead.  (Not sure how to get that though; he just said \"ask your IT\" but I don't think anyone here really knows as it's all abstracted away from us.)\nAnyway, hope that helps someone else at some point!"

    Useful stuff. GHC on Windows needs more love.  Lots of people use GHC on Windows but somehow very few people are willing ot give much help and support.  You are an exception -- thank you.

    A suggestion: would you feel like adding your insights to the GHC-on-Windows guidance page?
    http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Windows

    It's a wiki so you can edit it yourself.  You could point to your blog post or (better for readers) just fold your stuff into the material already there.

    It's linked from GHC's documentation page
    http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC
    (though perhaps not prominently enough.

    Thanks!

    Hello everyone!

    I don't know why Windows code should be treated differently. I think that call to withSocketsDo could be internally made on-demand basis or something like that.

    This problem with paths for cabal install could be resolved into the Haskell Platform installer directly and no one will hit it in the future.

It's really about integration. \n\nThe great hoards of developers out the world (hoards which are too big, because they work inefficiently in weak languages, certainly) are mainly involved in writing code that does very simple transformations, but which has to make the right transformations at the right time in the right order consistently (lazyness? Oh dear) on user input from these seven heterogenous, unreliable input channels, validated against reference data from these thirteen heterogenous data sources, wait for that mainframe to update, send an email to this repair queue, roll the response from the user there into the data, send the transformed data out to this random collection of unreliable, heterogenous channels, etc. etc. etc. And the upstream and downstream systems are changing all the time, and the rules about what transforms to do in what order are changing all the time, and so on.\n\nA very few (a lucky few) get to write a program which uses a complicated  algorithm to make a sophisticated transformation to some rich data, and banging on about how brilliantly Haskell can solve that problem is not going to impress anyone."

I believe that problems of that nature constitute the bulk of commercial programming.\n\nI'd love for FP to be the next big thing, but as currently formulated it doesn't seem to address enough of the day–to–day concerns of working programmers in ways which are compellingly better than what they have now (a depressingly low bar) to get any traction. We have at least now moved on from the world Monad tutorials which are much harder to understand than Monads are, but lengthy expositions on lenses aren't much of an improvement.\n\nBut what rankles me most is the all–to–common assertion by FP advocates that the problems I see teams deal with day in and day out in industry either don't exist, or if they do are irrelevant.

  content: It is funny how history just keeps repeating itself. It took 35+ years for OO to become mainstream. And the funny thing is that what people call OO is not even OO (Google Alan Kay). What people use instead is "let's have a number of global states instead of only one - Oriented Programming" or "Place Oriented Programming" as the Clojure guy expresses it. Erlang is probably the only truly OO language available today. And the twist is that it is a functional language. How funny that is. Functional programming will absolutely become main stream. But it will take a long time. And so what? It doesn't stop you or your team or your biz from taking advantage of the technology today. You don't need to wait for the rest of the herd to catch up. The leading edge guys started using C while the rest of the world were still bashing away in Cobol. I can imagine the Cobol guys back then shaking their heads going "Why use C? No software is written in it. Cobol is what everybody use." All I can say is don't wait for the herd. Move ahead and be part of the next "C guys" and don't stay with the "Cobol guys". Any thinking/practical tool that makes you more productive today is a good thing :-)

    This is so spot on. People who do their day to day work in language X, but wants to learn/use language Y, first really starts doing so once their day-to-day tasks is simple to do in language Y. And that often starts with a Google search and typing in some code you found on StackOverflow to hook up that Postgres database, or to set up that router for the web server. It does not start with "Learn you language Y for a greater good", good as that might be.

    The stupid, mundane stuff must be easy to do, and there has to be reference code you can easily look to. The amount of easy to use libs and great documentation is what really has made it easy for people to start using Node, as a recent example.

    Hei.

    Takk for fin blogg og nyttig informasjon om Altibox.

    Det er noe jeg stusser over og det er "Har du kommet så langt som dette så får du til ruting av TV-signalet selv."

    Trafikken fra media konverteren er VLAN tagget trafikk og det går TV,"Internett/data" og telefoni trafikk over kabelen som du kobler rett i WAN interfacet på pfSense boksen. Da må man route all trafikk gjennom pfsense boksen inklusive TV trafikk og du har kun et interface på innsiden som er konfigurert som en ren aksessport. Jeg ser ikke helt hvordan du skal få til dette. På ett eller annet sted i nettet må man ta ut minst to aksessporter. En til "data" og en til TV. Enten med flere interfacer på pfsense boksen eller en switch med støtte for VLAN.

    Mitt forslag er å ta ut TV nettet/VLAN'et før pfsens boksen så den slipper unødvendig å prosessere TV trafikken og skape unødvendig mere konfig. Kjøpe en switch med støtte for VLAN og definere den ene porten som en VLAN trunk for 100, 101 og 102 som kobles til konverteren og definere en ren aksessport i VLAN 101 som man kobler til pfsense boksen. Så definere et eget VLAN for det interne nettet etc. Da kan man ta ut TV og andre porter helt etter behov.

    Zyxel boksen til Altiboks er litt suspekt og hvilken tilstand den har i brigded modus. Det som gjør den suspekt er at man via et WEB grensesnitt kan enable og disable bridged modus. Det kan ikke være helt transparent i nettet siden man kan endre konfigen på den. Noe fishy er det med den og den kan sikkert med fordel fjernes slik at man ha en ren egen switch og en brannmur i en eller annen form (hvis ikke Altibox reagerer på at den er borte).

    Pål S.

    Hei, oppskriften er for hvordan unngå å ha ruter fra Lyse, kun fiber-konverter. Telsey-boksen din er en ruter. Selv om du setter denne i bridge-modus så håndterer den fortsatt å hente ut internett-signalet og dermed fjerne VLAN-tagen.

    Bare fjern VLAN innstillingen i pfSense, så er du i mål med PfSense som brannmur.

    Tusen takk for informativ blogg!!

    Jeg har et par spørsmål...

    Jeg har et CPL7 modem, hvor det sitter en SFP modul i. Jeg har ikke egen medieconverter. Kan jeg ta ut denne modulen, og sette inn i en medieconverter? I så fall, er det bare å skaffe en hvilken som helst gigabit medieconverter?

    Hva er egentlig fordelene med å velge IPv6 vs IPv4, om man allikevel har tenkt å kjøre et 192 LAN med NAT?

    Takk på forhånd! :)

    Hei

    Har du sett noen store endringer i latency ved å fjerne Zyxel modemet?

    Det er vel flere som meg som sliter med å få opp TV via Pfsense vil jeg anta?
    Har du noen god oppskrift på dette? Det er ikke bare å tagge med 101 og lage vlan tydeligvis.
    Internett fungerer perfekt, men ikke TV.

    I’m quite new to pfSense so blogs like yours were extremely helpful when I was getting started.
    I had NAT rule set up and it used to work for me. Happily using my appletv with Getflix for several months. All of a sudden (maybe a couple of weeks ago) it doesn’t anymore.
    I tried changing the source from the alias i had been using all this while to my device IP address but still didn’t work.

    It seems like the NAT port forward rule is being ignored.
    I wonder if it’s caused by a pfSense update? I’m using 2.4.4 release p2.
    I wonder if it’s because the redirect target IP actually cannot be an external IP?

    I’m kinda at a loss where to even start checking.
    Device IP is not changed and I checked DHCP leases (device IP is static mapped)

    Domain overrides works, but I want only specific devices to use the smartDNS server.

  content: The amber LED wired to pin D13 on the Arduino Nano causes leakage of voltage to other LEDs. My hack to fix it was to bend pin D13 on the Nano so it doesn't go in the socket hole, solder a wire from A5 pad to D13 pad (no longer connected to pin D13) and changed mappings.h definition for P12B to 0x00 and P12C to 0x20 (effectively replacing D13 with A5).

    I'm sorry that we didn't publish the original Sketchup files/STLs (I was too tired when I sent the files to Finn and sent the gcode ones instead by mistake). But great that you made SCAD versions and published them :)

    I haven't seen a floppy disk in 16 years, unbelievable story! :)

    However there seems to be a trend of software 'getting older'. The software I wrote 10 years ago had a life expectency of 2-3 years. Now days processor speeds don't double every 1.5 years and people are just sattisfied with their office 2003 suite.

    At this very moment I'm working on a 13 year old .NET codebase for a large company. It works and it will keep working for the coming years.

    Software is becoming an ancient craf :)

    I have somewhat a meta-question... As patients are free to switch, the information in principle gets outdated as soon as it is extracted from the government system, so whats the use of this information?

    Do doctors refuse to deal with patients not in their main list? Is it only about the number of available "slots" per doctor?

    Also, whats the average month-on-month turnover, eg how many changes per doctor and how many doctors with no change in list?

    P.S I DO hope the information on the floppy is somehow encrypted :D

    "far less time-consuming to write to than a CD-ROM."

    LOL!  Seriously?  With a 48X burner, I bet that I could write AND VERIFY at least 4-5 discs before a floppy drive can fill a floppy disc.  If you were using mini cd-r's, they would be more robust, lighter, and cost less to ship.

    If some of the data is the same, you could burn hundreds of discs at a time with automated duplicators.

    What an epic waste of time and taxpayer money.

    It is a "market" approximation, introduced in recent years, that necessitate this.

    Earlier you just went to the doctor that was on call at the time.

    Now you instead pick a doctor you stick with, in part to give a competitive incentive to the other doctors to step up their service quality (the thinking is some kind of off-shot of New Public Management).

    The problem is not the data, it is the software in use at the doctor end.

    It is DOS based, and thus likely don't have the first clue about anything beyond A: B: C: drives.

    Also, to do this via email would require an encryption infrastructure.

    Physical mail instead employ sealed envelopes and signature/id on delivery.

    Sure there is something to be gained: not sending out the majority of the floppies, i.e. all of those ones which contain unchanged data.

    There are approx. 4,500 GPs in Norway. If in a given month there are 500 GPs whose patient list changes (after all, "patients seldomly switch so the turnover is very low"), then it is unnecessary to send out the other 4,000 (~90%) floppies with the unchanged patient lists.

    Would you not be better off with some ~10W embedded and fanless Atom box running pfSense for this? A lot more to tinker with anyway, and upgradeable with next-gen WiFi by replacing just adapter or external AP. Initial cost could also be comparable to these higher-end plastic consumer boxes.

    To the point and assuming a powercycling fixes both of the issues, a dirty but quite effective remedy would be to put a cheap electronic timer between socket and PSU, programming it to switch off for a minute every morning at 5 AM...

  content: pfSense is great. But the Asus box has good 4G antenna sensitivity. A random box with pfSense would need a 4G adapter with external antenna. And a lot more time to set up properly compared to an out of the box product. Sometimes tinkering is fun, sometimes you just want stuff to work.

    I tried your suggestions, but it didn't help me. My Asus 4G-AC55U looses it's connection at times and it won't return until I reset the router manually. Finally I bought a Raspberry Pi and a Tellstick Duo and connected it all to a Nexa remote controlled power switch. Then I wrote a program that polls the Internet and if the connection is lost I toggle the Nexa socket.

    If someone is interested I wrote a small description of my setup on my web page: http://tomasheed.com/2017/04/tellstick-duo-raspberry-pi/

    Thanks Finn and Thor!

    I had not relaized that i had to "manualy" update the modem part of the router.  See link below
    https://www.asus.com/se/Networking/4G-AC55U/HelpDesk_BIOS/

    Did speed test before and after updating from M12 to M14 and this showed an significant decreas in downlink speed and increas in uplink speed after the update despite several powercycles of router.  Is this seen by others as well?

    Is there any known way of rebooting the modem part thru command line interface?  The modem seems to need a powercycle to come out of its bad state. Hopefully M14 will fix issue  thou...

  content: This looks very interesting.  Are you using the Gateway to control the switch? Did the modification take a long time?  I'd be interested in contacting you about making my on hacked switch.  Thanks for the info.

  content: I am using an ordinary switch as well as the gateway to control it, either way works. The mod itself is not too time-consuming, but it is a hassle to separate the top part from the bottom. Take care not to cut yourself as you work along the edge with a knife.

  content: Thanks, really nice! Did the same, works really well! I am using a smartthings hub and was able to set an automation to turn off then switch 10s later it was switched on, so no need to double switch.

  content: I recently applied this mod, thx to the good explanation it works! Many thanks, I was looking for a (zigbee) solution for my garagedoor but didn't find any plug-and-play on the market. Before this I modded a wifi (wofea) tuya by flashing it with tasmota but my config was not perfect. When loosing the wifi connection or after a powerloss the garagedoor opened automatic. Very anoying when it is night or when we were not at home...

    What the... who did that original paste job? It's everywhere!

    Less certainly is more. Unless your day job is putting Lenovo laptops together at a factory apparently.
